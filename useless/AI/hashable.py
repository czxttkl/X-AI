class hashable(object):
    '''Hashable wrapper for ndarray objects.

        Instances of ndarray are not hashable, meaning they cannot be added to
        sets, nor used as keys in dictionaries. This is by design - ndarray
        objects are mutable, and therefore cannot reliably implement the
        __hash__() method.

        The hashable class allows a way around this limitation. It implements
        the required methods for hashable objects in terms of an encapsulated
        ndarray object. This can be either a copied instance (which is safer)
        or the original object (which requires the user to be careful enough
        not to modify it).
